# Geppeto Navigator

A simple Nostr explorer built using Axum and HTMX. Find events on any 
relay using custom filters. Post any kind of event you like.

Supports `NIP-07` and `hex key` signing. 

## Demo Version

A client is maintained [here](https://geppeto.lat).

## TODO

I will slowly add the following features:

- Relay pools
- Send tagged events
- Find event trees

## Support 

I'm a third world developer doing fun open source stuff. If you liked this project throw me some sats:
